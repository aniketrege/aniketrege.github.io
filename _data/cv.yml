      description:
        - Improved performance of MultiView LidarNet on pedestrians, a critical safety and reliability issue for autonomous vehicles
        - Incorporation of pedestrian orientation-aware training schema to improve precision on cars by 21.3% and pedestrians by 14.7% at cost to recall
        - To model long-range dependencies in representation subspace of Lidar point cloud, added naive multi-head attention at deeper layers, as well as ViT-style patched multi-head attention at shallower layers
        - Creation of attention-augmented CNN improved overall pedestrian performance (+8% recall, +7.5% precision) at only +1.5 ms inference cost while also improving car performance
