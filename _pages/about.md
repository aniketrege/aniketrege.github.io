I'm a Ph.D student in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I spend most of time thinking about **heterogeneous preference learning** and **demographically diverse multimodal generative models**. I am fortunate to be jointly advised by [Ramya Vinayak](https://ramyakv.github.io/) and [Yong Jae Lee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/).

**Update**: I'm spending Summer '25 at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), working on multimodal contextual AI under [Hyo Jin Kim](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~hyojin/)!

Previously, I was an masters student at the University of Washington, Seattle where I worked with the RAIVN Lab advised by [Prof. Ali Farhadi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/) and mentored by [Aditya Kusupati](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kusupati/). My MS research focused on large-scale efficient and deployable machine learning, visual representation learning, and web-scale search.

<!-- In Summer â€˜22 I interned in the deep learning for autonomous vehicles team at NVIDIA Redmond on Multiview LidarNet, supervised by Dr. [Nikolai Smolyanskiy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KxfefwgAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Stan Birchfield](https://research.nvidia.com/person/stan-birchfield). Previously, I worked for several years as a research engineer at Samsung Research India, working on perception problems for the AI Camera, including as a founding member of [Single Take Camera](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-use-single-take-mode-on-samsung-phones), the USP of the Galaxy S20 flagship smartphone. -->

I am also generally interested in computer vision, information retrieval, efficient+deployable ML, and personalization for generative models. If you are an undergrad or masters student interested in working with me, send me an email (I'll do my best to reply)!
